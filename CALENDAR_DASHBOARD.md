### Backend Integration Points

The calendar is designed to easily integrate with Supabase or any backend:

1. **Replace Mock Data**: Swap `INITIAL_APPOINTMENTS` with API fetch
2. **API Endpoints Needed**:
   - `GET /appointments` - Fetch appointments
   - `POST /appointments` - Create appointment
   - `PUT /appointments/:id` - Update appointment
   - `DELETE /appointments/:id` - Delete appointment
   - `GET /staff` - Fetch staff list
   - `GET /services` - Fetch services

3. **Real-time Updates**: Add Supabase Realtime subscription for live updates across sessions

4. **Authentication**: Already has admin layout with user profile dropdown

## 📈 Performance

- **Fast Initial Load**: Optimized rendering
- **Smooth Interactions**: No lag on drag/drop or search
- **Efficient Filtering**: Memoized computations
